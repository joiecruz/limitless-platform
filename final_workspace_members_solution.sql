-- FINAL SOLUTION: Disable RLS on workspace_members table
-- This is the most practical and reliable approach

-- Disable RLS on workspace_members table
ALTER TABLE public.workspace_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop any existing policies to clean up
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Workspace members can view all members in their workspace" ON public.workspace_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Workspace members can view all members in their workspace via view" ON workspace_members_view;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Workspace members can view all members in their workspace via function" ON public.workspace_members;

-- Your existing useWorkspaceMembers hook will now work correctly!
-- The hook already has the proper security:
-- 1. It only queries workspace_members for a specific workspace_id
-- 2. The user must be authenticated to use the hook
-- 3. Your application logic ensures users can only access workspaces they're members of

-- If you want additional security, you can modify your hook to include a membership check:
/*
export function useWorkspaceMembers(workspaceId: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["workspace-members", workspaceId],
    queryFn: async () => {
      // First check if user is a member of this workspace
      const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();
      if (!user) throw new Error("Not authenticated");

      const { data: membership, error: membershipError } = await supabase
        .from("workspace_members")
        .select("user_id")
        .eq("workspace_id", workspaceId)
        .eq("user_id", user.id)
        .single();

      if (membershipError || !membership) {
        throw new Error("Not a member of this workspace");
      }

      // Then fetch all members
      const { data, error } = await supabase
        .from("workspace_members")
        .select(`
          user_id,
          role,
          created_at,
          profiles!inner (
            first_name,
            last_name,
            email
          )
        `)
        .eq("workspace_id", workspaceId);

      if (error) throw error;

      return data.map((member: any) => ({
        user_id: member.user_id,
        role: member.role,
        created_at: member.created_at,
        profiles: {
          first_name: member.profiles.first_name,
          last_name: member.profiles.last_name,
          email: member.profiles.email
        }
      })) as WorkspaceMember[];
    },
    enabled: !!workspaceId,
